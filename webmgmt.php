What we offer here is a solution to all your non-user-friendly problems!<br />
Not everyone knows how to upload files through FTP or code or use content management systems<br />
to run and maintain your website.<br />
<br />
Some people don't even know where to start!<br />
<br />
That's where I come in.  With my years of experience working on my own websites and pages that weren't<br />
my own, I've had a lot of experiences with many different schemes, systems, programs, etc.<br />
<br />
You may be thinking, "That sounds expensive.  How much does it cost?"  I only charge $50 a month<br />
as a fee for maintaining your website.  This includes, but isn't limited to:<br />
<br />
Uploading files, installing programs (Forums, E-commerce, etc), using content management (WordPress and other CMS<br />
modules), and more!  Any website designs must be discussed as well and can be paid for separately as part of a design<br />
package.  That being said:<br />
<br />
Spots are limited, as I am a one-man army and do all website maintenance duties myself.  I work full-time during the<br />
day so all clients will be serviced after that time.  However, I can be reached always at my email.  To discuss a website<br />
management contract and all the details that it entails, please click <a href="mailto:webmaster@marks-designs.com?subject=Websites">here</a>.<br />
<br />
I'll need to know details such as if you need help registering a domain, any images you may already have, and any contact<br />
information you can share.<br />
