Mark A. Lastes<br />
Owner/Founder/Design Artist<br />
<br />
Mark began designing after learning first hand how to code in HTML by creating layouts<br />
inspired by previously designed templates.  This went on for some time, slowly learning<br />
how to code in JavaScript and CSS and script in mIRC, literally putting hours in from the age<br />
of 14, learning code through the help of fantastic software and a myriad of other helpful websites<br />
and people existing in little corners of the internet.  One day Mark found Photoshop and with some tinkering<br />
found a great way to make Photoshop layouts and using PHP to have all content available on one page.<br />
<br />
After a sabbatical I decided to come back and relearn it all over again.  Only the language changed a little bit from what<br />
I used to know.<br />
<br />
I only do this for fun.  The money isn't what's important, it's giving people the ability to have a functioning website.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</center>
